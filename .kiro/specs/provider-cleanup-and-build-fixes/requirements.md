# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves cleaning up the codebase to remove unused provider integrations and cloud service references, while fixing TypeScript errors that prevent successful VSIX build. The goal is to maintain only the essential providers (OpenAI/OpenAI-native, Anthropic, and Google Gemini) and ensure the project can build a production-ready VSIX package.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused provider integrations from the codebase, so that the build is cleaner and only includes necessary dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify all provider-related code and configurations
2. WHEN unused providers are identified THEN the system SHALL remove all references to providers other than OpenAI/OpenAI-native, Anthropic, and Google Gemini
3. WHEN provider cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure no orphaned imports or references remain

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all cloud service references from the codebase, so that the application no longer depends on cloud services that are not being used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cloud service references are identified THEN the system SHALL remove all AWS, Azure, GCP, or other cloud service integrations
2. WHEN cloud service cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure no cloud service configuration files or imports remain
3. WHEN the cleanup is verified THEN the system SHALL confirm no cloud service dependencies exist in package.json files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix TypeScript compilation errors, so that the VSIX can be built successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compilation is run THEN the system SHALL identify all compilation errors
2. WHEN production-critical errors are identified THEN the system SHALL fix errors that prevent VSIX build
3. WHEN test file errors are encountered THEN the system SHALL ignore non-essential test errors that don't affect production build
4. WHEN all critical errors are fixed THEN the system SHALL successfully compile TypeScript without build-blocking errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the VSIX build process works correctly, so that I can distribute the updated extension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process is executed THEN the system SHALL successfully generate a VSIX file
2. WHEN the VSIX is created THEN the system SHALL verify it contains only the necessary provider integrations
3. WHEN the build is complete THEN the system SHALL confirm no unused dependencies are included in the final package
